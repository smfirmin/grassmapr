# grassmapr

The `grassmapr` package has two related objectives: (i) to predict the spatial 
distribution of terrestrial C~3~ and C~4~ grass cover – using input climate 
layers and crossover temperature - and (ii) to model plant stable carbon 
($\delta$^13^C) *isoscapes* by applying isotopic endmembers to plant functional 
type cover layers. The user may optionally include other (i.e., non-grass) 
vegetation layers (e.g., \% woody cover, \% crop, etc.).

## Background

The primary driver of $\delta$^13^C spatial variation in terrestrial plant 
tissue is the greater isotopic fractionation in C~3~ plants compared to C~4~ 
plants. The physiologically based crossover temperature model explains the 
turnover from C~3~ to C~4~ plants along gradients of temperature (Ehleringer et 
al. 1997, Collatz et al. 1998, Still et al. 2003).

The `grassmapr` package combines the crossover temperature model with gridded 
climate and land-cover data to predict the relative abundance of C~3~ and C~4~ 
vegetation distribution. Isotopic endmember values are then applied to map plant 
$\delta$^13^C, resulting in a spatially continuous representation, or isoscape. 
These layers are useful for understanding grass biogeography (e.g., Powell et al. 
2012, Griffith et al. 2015) and for studies seeking to identify the movement 
of animals (e.g., Hobson 1999, Bowen & West 2008).

Note that $\delta$^13^C also varies with photosynthetic subtype in C~4~ plants 
and with rainfall and water availability in woody C~3~ plants (Cerling & 
Harris 1999, Diefendorf et al. 2010, Kohn 2010). Currently, `grassmapr` 
functions neglect these secondary sources of spatial variation.
